					<h2>Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
					<p>I'm a data scientist based in Chicago, currently pursuing my master's degree in <a href="https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/in-person-program/">applied data science at UChicago</a> and interning in the <a href="https://rsginc.com/service/research-analytics/travel-model-development/">travel demand modeling group at RSG</a>.</p>
					<p>I spend a lot of time thinking about car dependency in the U.S. and how investments in active and public transport can improve our cities. I'm also a sports fanatic, and love applying my quantitative background to better understand sports at all levels.</p>
					<p>You can find some projects I've worked on below:</p>
