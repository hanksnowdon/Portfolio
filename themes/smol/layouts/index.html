					<h2>Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
					<p>I'm a data scientist based in Chicago, currently studying in an applied data science master's program at UChicago and interning in the travel demand modeling group at <a href="https://rsginc.com/">RSG</a>.</p>
					<p>I spend a lot of time thinking about car dependency in the U.S. and how investments in active and public transport can improve our cities. I'm also a sports fanatic, and love applying my quantitative background to better understand sports at all levels.</p>
