					<h2>Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
					<p>I'm a data scientist based in Chicago, currently pursuing my master's degree in <a href="https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/in-person-program/">applied data science @ UChicago</a>. In the last year I have completed research for the Chicago White Sox to develop a better understanding of hitting biomechanics, and interned at the transportation consultancy  <a href="https://rsginc.com/service/research-analytics/travel-model-development/">RSG</a>.</p>
					<p>I spend a lot of time thinking about car dependency in the U.S. and how investments in active and public transport can improve our cities. I'm also a sports fanatic, and love applying my quantitative background to better understand sports at all levels.</p>
					<p>A collection of publicly-available projects I've worked on can be found below. If you'd like to get in touch, please reach out on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hank-snowdon-849588159/">LinkedIn</a>! </p>
